# IndianRhythmDiscrimination
## Overview
This repository contains the stimuli, dataset and R analysis code used to investigate the interaction between rhythm cycle length, duration and structure for Hindustani/North Indian Classical Rhythms; focusing on the role of working memory capacity, rhythmic structure, and cognitive strategies.

> The paper associated with this project will be added here once it has completed the peer review process.

## Stimuli

The `Audio Stimuli` folder includes all rhythmic cycle audio files used in the study. It contains: *Reference (N)* and *N+1* and *N-1* versions for each of the four rhythmic cycles in 4 different durations.

---

## Datasets

IndianRhythmDiscrimination.csv contains the dataset (outlier removed) used in the study. It contains participant musical training, participant's raw responses (i.e. same or different on the Rhythmic Discrimination task), Participant responses on Chunk selection, each participant's DST Scores, and open ended responses on what Strategies they used for the rhythm discrimination task. For the full details of the task please see the article or contact the researcher.

## Usage
All analysis was conducted using **R**. To reproduce the results and visualizations:
The `Analysis_Script.md` file can be viewed in Github. To run the full code, you will have to open the 'Analysis_Script.Rmd' in R studio.

This data has been used by the researcher to understand the cognitive strategies and psychological factors responsible for the perception of long rhythmic cycles from North Indian Classical Music. It can also be used for creating a perceptual model for these rhythmic cycles and many other things. Please contact the researcher for any collaborations, and cite the paper if you use the stimuli, data or the analysis script.
